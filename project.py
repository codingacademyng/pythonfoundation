# *OLD PYTHON STUDENTS PROJECT*
# I'll be sending two different projects and you all are to decide the one you want to work. The one with the highest votes tomorrow would be your project.

# *ONLINE SHOPPING PROCESS*
# This project is divided into two main sections:
# 1) Bank App:
# i) Three Different Banks:
# The application provides access to three distinct banks.
# ii) User Registration and Login:
# Users can register or log in to any of the available banks.
# iii) User Information Storage:
# Information of registered users is securely stored in the respective bank's database.
# iv) Banking Operations:
# Users have the capability to perform banking operations, such as depositing money, transferring funds, and checking their account balance.
# v) Navigation Function:
# The app includes a navigation function allowing users to seamlessly switch between the bank and shopping mall functionalities.

# 2) Shopping Mall App:
# i) Three Shopping Categories:
# The shopping mall app offers three distinct categories for users to explore: Clothing, Food, and Drinks.
# ii) Product Information:
# Within each category, users can view product details, including name, price, and available quantity.
# iii) User Authentication:
# The app features a secure login and registration process, and user information is stored in the database.
# iv) Cart Management:
# Users can add items to their cart, but the checkout process requires user authentication.
# v) Checkout Process:
# During checkout, users must choose one of the three available banks for payment. They input their account number and password, and the app verifies their status as registered users.
# vi) Payment Confirmation:
# If the user's credentials are successfully confirmed, the app debits the user's account based on the total price of the purchased goods, ensuring sufficient funds are available.
# vii) Transaction Logging:
# After a successful transaction, the app logs the details of the transaction in the sales table. This includes information about the purchasing customer, as well as the name, price, and quantity of the purchased goods.
# viii) Quantity Update:
# Additionally, the quantity column for the selected category is updated to reflect the change in the quantity of the purchased goods. This ensures accurate and up-to-date inventory management.

# *EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM*
# As a contracted developer for the event management app, the application encompasses the following features:
# User Authentication:
# The app includes a secure login and registration feature to authenticate incoming users.
# User credentials are securely saved on the database.
# Authenticated User Functions:
# Upon successful authentication, users gain access to two main functions: Creating Event and Viewing Events.
# Creating Event Feature:
# i) Event Categories:
# Users can add events under distinct categories, such as Wedding, Birthday, and Funeral.
# ii) Event Details Input:
# Users are prompted to input the day, month, year, location, and time of the event.
# iii) Database Storage:
# The entered information, including the user's details, is securely stored in the database.
# Viewing Event Feature:
# i) Event Category Selection:
# Users are prompted to choose an event category to view.
# ii) Viewing Events on the Current Day:
# If the user opts to see all events happening on the current day (determined by the user's system date):
# If no events are scheduled, the user is informed accordingly.
# If events are scheduled, the user receives information about all the events in this type of format: "...(event-host)... is having a ...(event-type)... event at ...(event-location)... today."
# iii) Viewing Events on a Specific Date:
# If the user chooses to specify the day, month, and year of the event:
# If no events are scheduled for the specified date, the user is informed.
# If events are scheduled, the user receives information in this type of format: "...(event-host)... is having a ...(event-type)... event at ...(event-location)... on ...(event-date)..."
# iv) Viewing User's Own Events:
# Users have the ability to view events created by themselves.
# This comprehensive event management app ensures secure user authentication, effective event creation, and convenient event viewing, providing users with a seamless experience for planning and attending various events.

# Further questions can be discussed tomorrow in class.
# Also, you're free to consult me if you find yourself stuck in any area.
